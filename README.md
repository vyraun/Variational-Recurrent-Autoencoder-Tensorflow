#Variational Recurrent Autoencoder
An implementation of the paper [Generating sentences from a continuous space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06349v4.pdf) written in tensorflow.

Note that this model is not the one described in [Variational recurrent auto-encoders O. Fabius et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6581.pdf).

under progress:
  beam search
  sampled softmax
  sampled from latent space
  interpolation in the latent space
  tensorboard
  carefully examine api call
  discover the possibility of acceleration
  comment completion
